    <p>
      We are three Computer Engineering students at Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering (CUFE).
      Last year, during our preparatory studies, we ranked among the top 70 students in our class.
      Working as a team has always been one of our strongest points, and together weâ€™ve taken part in multiple projects that sharpened both our technical and collaborative skills
